### Part 1
Compare two strings of ASCII characters to see which is larger (i.e., which
follows the other in alphabetical ordering). Both strings have the same
length as defined by the **LENGTH** variable. The stringsâ€™ starting addresses
are defined by the **START1** and **START2** variables. If the string defined by
**START1** is greater than or equal to the other string, clear the **GREATER**
variable; otherwise set the variable to all ones ***(0xFFFFFFFF)***.
